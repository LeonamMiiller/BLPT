Brutal Legend *.~h and *.~p Package extractor/inserter

This tool can be used to dump data from the *.~h/*.~p files used on the game Brutal Legend.
It has been tested on the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game.
It can insert the files back aswell, but you need to keep the same names!
Instructions can be found on the "usage" of the program, just open it on CMD and read the usage.

I'm not responsible for damage that this tool can cause to your files. A backup is recommended before you attempt to do any changes.
Insertion for the PS3 version of the game is untested. It's also unknown if this tool works with the PC version, probably not.
If anyone wants PC support, just send me a file from the PC version, as I only have files from the PS3 and X360 versions.
